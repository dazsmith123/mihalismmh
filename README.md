I have now implemented Smarty templater into Mihalism and am confident I can now get the project moving forward.

Unfortunately, while not completely impossible, the way Mihalism handled templates, just means there's alot of work to do for me.

My main aim is to optimise the software, and with that comes the smarty templater, without change the template system, there's not much point going further I decided, and so it will take a bit longer than originally planned while I rewrite templates, but I will not give up on it.

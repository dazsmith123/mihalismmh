Daz here again, I am moving forward with the Mihalism-SE project and have a sneaky preview of one of the new features for you.

Here you go:

As well as the new features above, the smarty templater is now fully implemented and working, also the PDO database class and queries are working and have been tested too.

The security has also been majorly improved with proper escaping methods being used in the script, many known and unknown security holes existing in the official release are fixed in Mihalism-SE.

Mihalism-SE will be released within the next month.

Stay tuned for more updates


PS. Currently I will just use this readme file as a 'whiteboard' and refork the project when it's ready.

Daz here again, I am moving forward with the Mihalism-SE project and have a sneaky preview of one of the new features for you.

Here you go:

Currently I will just use this readme file as a 'whiteboard' and refork the project when it's ready.

Mihalism-SE will be released within the next month.

Stay tuned for more updates

<h1>Mihalism Multihost - Updated Fork</h1>

I am planning to update Mihalism Multihost after all these years, since it seems that no-one else is going to do it. ;)

My Targets:
<ul>
  <li>PHP7 Support</li>
  <li>PDO Support - more secure, prepared database queries.</li>
  <li>Implementing the Smarty templating system to help with script performance.</li>
  <li>Improve the overall performance and security of Mihalism Multi Host and bring it up to date with today's technology, generally.</li>
</ul>

This will be a large task:
<ul>
  <li>All database queries should be updated</li>
  <li>All template files should be updated</li>
</ul>
  
<p>Today, 08-06-2019 I have started working on Mihalism. Let's make this the script it once was again. If you would like more information about the status / completion of this fork, please contact me at my personal email address dsmith[at]dazsmith.net</p>

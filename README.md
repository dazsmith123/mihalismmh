<h1>Mihalism Multihost - Updated Fork</h1>

I am planning to update Mihalism Multihost after all these years, since it seems that no-one else is going to do it. ;)

My Targets:
<ul>
  <li>PHP7 Support</li>
  <li>PDO Support - more secure, prepared database queries.</li>
  <li>Implementing the Smarty templating system to help with script performance.</li>
  <li>Improve the overall performance and security of Mihalism Multi Host and bring it up to date with today's technology, generally.</li>
</ul>

This will be a large task:
<ul>
  <li>All database queries should be updated</li>
  <li>All template files should be updated</li>
</ul>
  
<p>
  UPDATE: 10/06/2019
  <ul>
    <li>All database queries have now been revised and Mihalism is running very stable and is much faster purely because of these changes to the database class and queries.</li>
    <li>The template system still has alot to be done.</li>
    <li>The estimated completetion time date is: <b>15/07/2019</b>.</li>
    <li>This fork will be named as '<b>Mihalism Gold Edition</b>'</li>
    </ul>
</p>

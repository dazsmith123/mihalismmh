Unfortunately I am unable to implement Smarty due to the way Mihalism is handling template files, and so that is what is going to be done.

The easiest way I have found to implement Smarty would be to recode the whole Mihalism software, don't stop reading yet, because that is what is going to be done - with the use of resources from Mihalism, I am starting a fresh, with a blank page.

The name will stay the same: 'Mihalism Special Edition' (Mihalism-SE), the theme will stay the same, most features in default 5.0.3 version will be there, only the underlying code will be different!

This will take a few months to get a first version out, so stay tuned for updates.

Notes:

-If there is enough demand after release of the fork, I will write an upgrade script for v5.0.x users. That means existing image hosts will be able to upgrade to Mihalism-SE with little effort. If you are interested in this, feel free to contact me to let me know.

-The estimated completion date of this fork will be sometime in middle of <strong>July 2019</strong>.

-You can contact me for any further details or updates @ daz[at]dazsmith.net.

Best wishes,
